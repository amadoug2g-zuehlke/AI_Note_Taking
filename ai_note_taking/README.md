# AudioMemo

AudioMemo is a note-taking app built using Flutter and Dart that allows you to transcribe your audio recordings into text.

## Installation

To use AudioMemo, you need to clone the repository and add your OpenAI API key for the transcription API in the **lib/utils/credentials.dart** file. You can get your API key by following the instructions on the transcription [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/research/whisper). Here is the [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio) for reference.

Once you've added your API key, run the following command in the project directory to install the dependencies:

    flutter pub get

After that, you can run the app on your emulator or physical device with:

    flutter run

## Future Features

Planning to add more note organization options.
